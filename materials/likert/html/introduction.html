<p>
In this experiment, you will be given pairs of verbs along with a 7-point similarity scale. Your job will be to rate the similarity between the <u>meanings</u> of the two verbs from <i>very dissimilar</i> (<b>1</b>) to <i>very similar</i> (<b>7</b>). 
</p>

<p>
For instance, if you received the verbs <i>eat</i> and <i>devour</i>, you might respond with a high similarity rating—perhaps a <b>6</b> or a <b>7</b>—since the meanings of <i>eat</i> and <i>devour</i> are quite similar. On the other hand, if you received the verbs <i>kill</i> and <i>kiss</i>, you might respond with a low similarity rating—perhaps a <b>1</b> or a <b>2</b>—since the meanings of <i>kill</i> and <i>kiss</i> are quite dissimilar.

The experiment will begin with a practice to get you used to the task. After this, a message will tell you that you are moving on to the experiment.

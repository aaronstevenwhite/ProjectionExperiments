    In this experiment, we're interested in finding out how similar certain verbs are to each other. During the experiment, you will get lists of three verbs at a time. For example, you could get something like this.

     <ol><ol><ol><ol><ol><ol><ol>
        <li>shout</li>
        <li>whisper</li>
        <li>yell</li>
     </ol></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol>
          
    Your job is to <i>choose the verb that has a meaning <b>least</b> like the others'</i>. You can make your choice either by clicking on the verb or by pressing its corresponding number key. So for the example above, you might have thought "whisper" was least like "shout" or "yell", since whispering involves speaking quietly and shouting and yelling both involve speaking loudly. To make your choice, you would have either clicked on "whisper" or pressed the number 2 on your keyboard.

    If you're unsure about which verb to choose, don't worry. Some of the lists of verbs will have a clear odd-man-out, while for others, it will be less clear which verb to choose. There is no right answer in any of the lists, so just rely on your gut instinct about which verb is least like the others. <i>Try <b>not</b> to overthink your decision</i>; just choose the first verb that pops out to you as having a meaning that differs from the others.

	Also, don't worry about trying to be consistent in your answers. Even though it may seem like it during the experiment, you will never see the same list twice.

    The experiment will start with three practice trials to get you warmed up. After that you will see a screen letting you know that the experiment is about to begin. You will then be given 203 lists in total. This shouldn't take you much longer than 15-25 minutes to complete.
